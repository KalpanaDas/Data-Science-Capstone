# Data Science Capstone
This repository contains my work for the Coursera course "Data Science Capstone". The data used for this is from the below source. 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

1. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
2. A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

The Shiny app for the the assignment is available at: https://kalpanadas.shinyapps.io/ShinyApp/
The Pitch presentation is available at: https://rpubs.com/Kalpana_Das/647170
The Milestone Report on RPubs is available at: https://rpubs.com/Kalpana_Das/646738
The source code files for the Shiny app, the Pitch presentation and the Milestone Report are available on my GitHub repository at: https://github.com/KalpanaDas/Data-Science-Capstone/

Thank you!!
