# Data Science Capstone
This repository contains my work for the Coursera course Data Science Capstone.

The data used for this is from the below source. 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

1. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

2. A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

The Shiny app for the the assignment is available at: https://sriharshams.shinyapps.io/data-science-capstone/

The pitch presentation is available at: http://rpubs.com/sriharshams/capstone

The code files and presentation files are available on my GitHub repo: https://github.com/KalpanaDas/Data-Science-Capstone/
